## Naive Bayes 

Naive Bayes: Naive Bayes comes under supervising machine learning which used to make classifications of data sets. It is used to predict things based on its prior knowledge and independence assumptions.

They call it naive because itâ€™s assumptions (it assumes that all of the features in the dataset are equally important and independent) are really optimistic and rarely true in most real-world applications.

It is classification algorithm which makes the decision for the unknown data set. It is based on Bayes Theorem which describe the probability of an event based on its prior knowledge.

Below diagram shows how naive Bayes works

alternative methods for classification problems in machine learning includes

*   Decision trees
*   K nearest neighbors
*   Neural networks
*   Support Vector machines

### Advantages of Naive Bayes

- Does not require a lot of training data
- It is super fast
- Simple and easy to implement
- Handles both continuous and Discrete data

### Disadvantages of Naive Bayes

 - Makes very strong assumption on conditional independence
 
## How to use Naive Bayes Algorithm ?

Let's take an example of how N.B works 
 
 
## Conclusion

In spite of the over-simplified assumptions, naive Bayes classifiers work quite well in many real-world situations like in document classification, Recommender system and spam filtering. And they are extremely fast and simple.
