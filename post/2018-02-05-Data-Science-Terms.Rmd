## Data Science Terminology

Based upon personal experience, research, and various industry experts' advice, someone delving
into the art of data science should take every opportunity to understand and gain experience as well as proficiency with the following list of common data science terms:

  
#### Statistical population

Statistical population as a recordset (or a set of records). This set or group of records will be of similar items or events that are of interest to the data scientist for some experiment. 

If a sample of a population is chosen accurately, characteristics of the entire population (that the sample is drawn from) can be estimated from the corresponding characteristics of the sample.


#### Probability

This is possible upcoming events and the likelihood of them actually occurring. 
This compares to a statistical thought process that involves analyzing the
frequency of past events in an attempt to explain or make sense of the observations. 

In addition, the data scientist will associate various individual events, studying the relationship of these events. How these different events relate to each other governs the methods and rules that will need to be followed when we're studying their probabilities.


#### False Positives

The idea of false positives is a very important statistical (data science) concept. A false positive is a mistake or an errored result. That is, it is a scenario where the results of a process or experiment indicate a fulfilled or true condition when, in fact, the condition is not true (not fulfilled). This situation is also referred to by some data scientists as a false alarm and is most easily understood by considering the idea of a recordset or statistical population that is determined not only by the accuracy of the processing but by the characteristics of the sampled population. In other words, the data scientist has made errors during the statistical process, or the recordset is a population that does not have an appropriate sample (or characteristics) for what is being investigated. The idea of false positives closely relates to confusion matrix.

#### Statistical Inference

Given a sample from a population, Statistical inference makes estimates about population characteristics. This can be either point estimate or interval estimate.
It includes testing various hypotheses and deriving estimates.

#### Regression

Regression is a process or method (selected by the data scientist as the best fit technique for the experiment at hand) used for determining the relationships among variables. 

More precisely, regression is the process that helps the data scientist comprehend how the typical value of the dependent variable (or criterion variable) changes when any one or more of the independent variables is varied while the other independent variables are held fixed


#### Fitting

Fitting is the process of measuring how well a statistical model or process describes a data scientist's observations pertaining to a recordset or experiment. These measures will attempt to point out the discrepancy between observed values and probable values. The probable values of a model or process are known as a distribution or a probability distribution. Therefore, a probability distribution fitting (or distribution fitting) is when the data scientist fits a
probability distribution to a series of data concerning the repeated measurement of a variable phenomenon.

The object of a data scientist performing a distribution fitting is to predict the probability or to forecast the frequency of, the occurrence of the phenomenon at a certain interval.


### Categorical data

Categorical variables are measured on nominal or ordinal measurement scales, In many ways qualitative variables are similar to categorical variables as both use either nominal or ordinal measurement scales.

Sometimes an observer may decide to record his/her observation using categories. 
The type and number of categories depend upon the type of interaction and the observer’s choice about how to classify the observation. For example, passive/active (two categories); introvert/extrovert (two categories); always/sometimes/never (three categories); strongly agree/agree/uncertain/disagree/strongly disagree (five categories). 

> Categorical data is displayed graphically by bar charts and pie charts.
> Categorical data can take numerical values, but those numbers don’t have any mathematical meaning.
> Chi-square test of goodness of fit can be applied to categorical variables

### Classification

Statistical classification of data is the process of identifying which category (discussed in the previous section) a data point, observation, or variable should be grouped into. The data science process that carries out a classification process is known as a classifier.

Determining whether a book is fiction or non-fiction is a simple example
classification. An analysis of data about restaurants might lead to the classification of them among several genres.

> Accuracy metric is not a good idea for imbalanced class problems.
> Precision and recall metrics are good for imbalanced class problems.
