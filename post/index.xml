A Data science process is a life cycle process for delivering a data science project that helps a data consumer to gain insights from the data.
It involves the following steps. They are as follows:
Describing the data problem by asking the right questions
Collecting the data
Transforming the raw data in to the format required applying Data munging techniques
Exploring Data by using EDA techniques
Advanced Exploratory data analysis.</description></item><item><title>Machine Learning Frameworks</title><link>https://laxmikants.github.io/post/machine-learning-frameworks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://laxmikants.github.io/post/machine-learning-frameworks/</guid><description>HUGOMORE42 Machine Learning Frameworks
Creation of frameworks is one of the most important advances in practical machine learning involved the creation of frameworks.
Many aspects of developing Frameworks are automated by machine learning applications, allowing developers to re-use code and take advantage of best practices.
This post introduces five of the most popular frameworks:
Torch
Theano
Caffe
Keras
TensorFlow
Torch
Torch originally released in 2002 by Ronan Collobert for the purpose of numeric computing.</description></item><item><title>Time-Series Forecasting</title><link>https://laxmikants.github.io/post/time-series-data-analysis/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://laxmikants.github.io/post/time-series-data-analysis/</guid><description>HUGOMORE42 What is time series?
A time series is a series of observations collected at some time intervals.
Time is an important component here. The observations collected are dependent on the time at which it is collected.
The sale items in a retail store like Walmart will be a time series. The sale could be at daily level or weekly level.
The number of people flying from Bangalore to delhi on daily basis is a time series.</description></item><item><title>Decision Trees</title><link>https://laxmikants.github.io/post/decision-trees-in-ml/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://laxmikants.github.io/post/decision-trees-in-ml/</guid><description>HUGOMORE42 Decision trees
Decision trees area tree-like tool which can be used to represent a cause and its effect.
In Machine Learning Decision trees are a type of Supervised machine learning where data
is split according to given parameter while constructing a tree to solve a given problem.
In decision tree there is a predictor variable and target variable or the desired output.
The predictor variable could be anything such as technical indicators etc and the target
variable could be desired output for example whether to invest in a given financial security or not.</description></item><item><title>Logistic Regression in ML</title><link>https://laxmikants.github.io/post/logistic-regression-in-ml/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://laxmikants.github.io/post/logistic-regression-in-ml/</guid><description>HUGOMORE42
Logistic Regression
Introduction
Logistic regression is a classification algorithm used to assign
observations to a discrete set of classes. Unlike linear regression
which outputs continuous number values, logistic regression transforms
its output using the logistic sigmoid function to return a probability
value which can then be mapped to two or more discrete classes.
Comparison to linear regression
Given data on time spent studying and exam scores. linear_regression
and logistic regression can predict different things:</description></item><item><title>Regression in ML</title><link>https://laxmikants.github.io/post/regression-in-ml/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://laxmikants.github.io/post/regression-in-ml/</guid><description>HUGOMORE42
Definition
A linear equation that models a function such that if we give any x to it, it will predict a value y , where both x and y are input and output variables respectively. These are numerical and continous values.
It is the most simple and well known algorithm used in machine learning.
Flowchart
The above Flowchart represents that we choose our training set, feed it to an algorithm, it will learn the patterns and will output a function called Hypothesis function &#39;H(x)&#39;.</description></item><item><title>Data Science Terminology</title><link>https://laxmikants.github.io/post/data-science-terminology/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://laxmikants.github.io/post/data-science-terminology/</guid><description>HUGOMORE42 Data Science Terminology
Based upon personal experience, research, and various industry experts’ advice, someone delving
into the art of data science should take every opportunity to understand and gain experience as well as proficiency with the following list of common data science terms:
Statistical population
Statistical population as a recordset (or a set of records). This set or group of records will be of similar items or events that are of interest to the data scientist for some experiment.</description></item><item><title>Websites with blogdown</title><link>https://laxmikants.github.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://laxmikants.github.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/</guid><description>1 Read up on blogdown

This post describes the key features of stringr’s regular expressions, as implemented by stringi. It is not a tutorial, so if you’re unfamiliar regular expressions, I’d recommend starting at http://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html. If you want to master the details, I’d recommend reading the classic Mastering Regular Expressions by Jeffrey E. F. Fried.
Regular expressions are the default pattern engine in stringr.</description></item><item><title>Proportion test in R</title><link>https://laxmikants.github.io/post/proportion-test-in-r/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://laxmikants.github.io/post/proportion-test-in-r/</guid><description>Hypothesis testing and P-values: Suppose our data are such that out of a sample of n=180 trials (=students), 120 resulted in successes (=indicated that they are in favor of lowering the drinking age to below 18 years). Our goal is to test hypotheses and construct confidence intervals about the true (unknown) proportion of successes (proportion of students who are in favor of lowering the drinking age) in the entire population. Let’s lookat a two-sided test of the (alternative) hypothesis that the true proportion is different from 0.</description></item><item><title>Tex formulas</title><link>https://laxmikants.github.io/post/apply-tex-coding-for-complex-mathematical-formulas/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://laxmikants.github.io/post/apply-tex-coding-for-complex-mathematical-formulas/</guid><description>TeX can be used to code complex statistical formulas.
