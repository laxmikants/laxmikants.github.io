```

# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
fit
```



### Headers

Sometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents.
Start lines with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

You can use  one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.

If you'd like to include a quote, use the > character before the line:

> My Software never has bugs. It just develops random features.

### Lists

Sometimes you need numbered lists (here to some useful resources for markdown):

1. [Markdown Basics from R-Studio](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html)
1. [Mastering Markdown from GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) (this is where most of the examples above come from)

And sometimes you want bullet points (the kind of things you can do with R markdown
if you want to go beyond the basics):

- [Lots of options for embedded R code](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_rcodechunks.html) (more details below)
- [Bibliographies and References](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
- [Interactive Documents](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_shiny.html)
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before:
    - Like this
    - And this

### Equations

Equation support can be very handy if you need to provide some formulas in your
text, just use $\LaTeX$ [math](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics): $x=\sum\beta\frac{\pi^2}{\gamma_i}$

Or more complicated large ones:

$$
f(n) =
  \begin{cases}
    n/2       & \quad \text{if } n \text{ is even}\\
    -(n+1)/2  & \quad \text{if } n \text{ is odd}\\
  \end{cases}
$$

### Images

If you want to embed images, this is how you do it:

![Pluto loves you](http://i.space.com/images/i/000/048/999/i02/pluto-new-horizons-july-2015.jpg?1437582878)

And now time for a horizontal break and off to R!

## inline code snippets

**R markdown** is a version of Markdown that is expanded to support running R code
in between your text. The blocks of R code are called `chunks` and you can treat
them as individual little segments of code, you can jump back and forth between them,
run just individual ones or run all of them when you click the **Knit** button - this
will generate a document that includes both content as well as the output of any
embedded R code chunks within the document. This is an R code chunk:

```{r my-first-chunk}
data <- cars # get the cars data set as an example
summary(data) # show a summary of the data set
```

You can also print out your data in table format if you want to include it in
your document:

```{r, results="asis"}
library(knitr)
kable(head(data))
```

Or you can print out the value of a variable in your text, say the value of $\pi$
with 4 significant digits: `r signif(pi, 4)` or the number of data points in
your data set: `r nrow(data)`.



## Executing R code 

```{r}
Input =("
Procrastination.level  low  medium  high
Male                   8       12   6
Female                 2       21   3
")

mat = as.matrix(read.table(textConnection(Input),
                   header=TRUE, 
                   row.names=1))
chisq.test(mat,
           correct=FALSE)                   

```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots. See Figure \@ref(fig:pie) for example:

```{r pie, fig.cap='A fancy pie chart.', tidy=FALSE}
par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c('Sky', 'Sunny side of pyramid', 'Shady side of pyramid'),
  col = c('#0292D8', '#F7EA39', '#C4B632'),
  init.angle = -50, border = NA
)
```


For additional information on R and R markdown, there are lots of great resources
on the internet and the R user community is very active and extremely helpful. Often,
googling what you'd like to achieve will provide a good starting point but I can
also recommend the following resources specifically:

 - [R reference manual](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf) (a great overview of many useful R commands)
 - [Regression analysis functions](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Ricci-refcard-regression.pdf) (statistical analysis is one of the great strengths of R, this is a handy overview of useful functionality)
 - [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) (a Q&A site for programming, searching for answers here often provides very helpful information)

With that, time to jump to the last item

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# This code chunk simply makes sure that all the libraries used here are installed, it will not be shown in the report (notice echo = FALSE).
packages <- c("readxl", "knitr", "tidyr", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "plotly")
if ( length(missing_pkgs <- setdiff(packages, rownames(installed.packages()))) > 0) {
  message("Installing missing package(s): ", paste(missing_pkgs, collapse = ", "))
  install.packages(missing_pkgs)
}
```

# Including Slides

```{r}
knitr::include_url("https://laxmikants.github.io/R-markdown/slides/Lession1.html#1", height = "400px")
```



```{r}
knitr::include_url("https://laxmikants.github.io/R-markdown/slides/Lession2.html#1", height = "400px")
```
