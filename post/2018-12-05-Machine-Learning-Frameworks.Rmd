## Machine Learning Frameworks

Creation of frameworks is one of the most important advances in practical machine learning involved the creation of frameworks. 
Many aspects of developing Frameworks are automated by machine learning applications, allowing developers to re-use code and take advantage of best practices. 

This post introduces five of the most popular frameworks: 

- Torch   

- Theano   

- Caffe   

- Keras  

- TensorFlow  

### Torch

Torch originally released in 2002 by Ronan Collobert for the purpose of numeric computing. The computations of Torch involves multidimensional arrays called tensors. Tensors can be processed with regular vector or matrix operations. Torch acquired routines for building, training, and evaluating neural networks.Corporations like IBM and Facebook had great deal of interest in Torch. But its adoption has been limited by its reliance on Lua as its interface language. The other frameworks Theano, Caffe, Keras, and TensorFlow — can be interfaced through Python, which has emerged as the language of choice in the machine learning domain.

### Theano


Theano was developed in 2010 by machile learning group  at the University of Montreal. It was released as a library for numeric computation. 
Like NumPy, Theano also provides a wide range of Python modules for operating on multi-dimensional arrays. but theano stores operations in a data structure called a graph, which it compiles into high performance code. Theano supports symbolic differentiation, which makes it possible to find derivatives of functions automatically. Because of its high performance and symbolic differentiation, many machine learning developers have adopted Theano as their numeric computation toolset of choice. Developers particularly appreciate Theano’s ability to execute graphs on graphics processing units (GPUs) as well as central processing units (CPUs).

### Caffe

This framework as developed at UC Berkeley. It is a framework for developing image recognition applications. As others joined in the development, Caffe expanded to support other machine learning algorithms and many different types of neural networks. Caffe is written in C++, and like Theano, it supports GPU acceleration. This emphasis on performance has endeared Caffe to many academic and corporate developers. Facebook has become particularly interested in Caffe, and in 2007 it released a reworked version called Caffe2. This version improves Caffe’s performance and makes executing applications on smartphones possible.

### Keras

Keras is modular and simple machine learning framework. François Chollet created Keras as an interface to other machine learning frameworks, and many developers access Theano through Keras to combine Keras’s simplicity with Theano’s performance. Keras’s simplicity stems from its small API and intuitive set of functions. These functions focus on accomplishing standard tasks in machine learning, which makes Keras ideal for newcomers to the field but of limited value for those who want to customize their operations. François Chollet released Keras under the MIT License, and Google has incorporated his interface into TensorFlow. For this reason, many TensorFlow developers prefer to code their neural networks using Keras.

### TensorFlow

The Google Brain team released TensorFlow 1.0 in 2015, the current version is 1.4. It’s provided under the Apache 2.0 open source license, which means anyone is free to use it modify it and distribute modifications. Python is the primary interface in TensorFlow, but like Caffe, its core functionality is written in C++ for performance. Like Theano, TensorFlow stores operations in a graph that can be deployed to a GPU, a remote system, or a network of remote systems. In addition, TensorFlow has a utility called TensorBoard, which makes visualizing graphs and their operations possible. TensorFlow supports execution on CPUs and GPUs. In addition, TensorFlow applications can be executed on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
