A Data science process is a life cycle process for delivering a data science project that helps a data consumer to gain insights from the data.
It involves the following steps. They are as follows:
Describing the data problem by asking the right questions
Collecting the data
Transforming the raw data in to the format required applying Data munging techniques
Exploring Data by using EDA techniques
Advanced Exploratory data analysis.</description></item><item><title>Time-Series Forecasting</title><link>https://laxmikants.github.io/post/time-series-data-analysis/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://laxmikants.github.io/post/time-series-data-analysis/</guid><description>HUGOMORE42 What is time series?
