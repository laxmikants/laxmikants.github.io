## Big-data and Analytics:

Do we know how we can reach at a decision based on mobile data or computer data or Aadhar number? How to find that the new accounts that are opened in the Pradhan Mantri's Jan Dhan Yojana does not have enough money ?

How does company know that their brand is making consumers happy or not? OK, this works based on the Big-data Analytics. Lets us understand what this is,  When we call it Big Data Analytics then this directly links us i.e. consumer. Many companies are selling their products online. To find the righteousness of the sells Big-data helps.

Let us assume that someone is claiming that they have a certain number of hits of the consumer on their web-site, but those number of hits cannot be true unless the consumer have done those number of purchases because someone cannot be claimed as consumer unless he/she purchases something, now this indicates towards unstructured data. When data is structured and some conclusion is drawn from it then it will be known as Big Data Analysis.

Lets us understand it with the help of an example:-

There is a manufacturer of jewellery in Surat in India. He has started his website recently. Now he wants to increase the sales on the online platform only. He comes to Delhi and gets a very beautiful website. He has also made arrangements that his website shows up on the top of the google search results, now this kind or arrangement is known as search engine optimization. He is very excited from this. He was very excited that all over the world his website was visited by around 5000 people daily but within a month this excitement went down because out of those only 20 percent used to purchase. He was not able to understand the fact and was trying to increase the sales. Then one of his friends told him about Big data analytics firm in Bangalore. He was not able to understand that what that company will do. His friend told him that Big Data analysis will help him know the trends of the web site visited by the consumers. This will help him get the future strategy of the online jewelry business.

This may contain the data or information about lakhs, crores or millions of people. This data may come from sources such as customers connect center, social media, mobile data etc. These kinds of numbers are known as structured data but these are not complete. To get to the roots of these is difficult.
