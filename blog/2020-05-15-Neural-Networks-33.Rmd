## Neural Networks

The Neural Network is one of the most powerful learning algorithms when a linear classifier doesn't work, this is what we usually turn to.

#### STRUCTURE OF A NEURAL NETWORK

With neural networks we are trying to build our models based on the structure of the human brain, namely with neurons. The human brain is composed of multiple billions of neurons which are interconnected. Neural networks are structures which try to use a similar principle.

In the figure above, we can see three layers. First the input layer , at the end the output layer and in between the hidden layer .

Obviously the input layer is where our inputs go. There we put all the things which are being entered or sensed by the script or the machine. Basically these are our features.

We can use neural networks to classify data or to act on inputs and the output layer is where we get our results. These results might be a class or action steps. Maybe when we input a high temperature into our model, the output will be the action of cooling down the machine.

All the layers between input and output are called hidden layers . They make the model more abstract and more complex. They extend the internal logic.

The more hidden layers and neurons you add, the more sophisticated the model gets.

Here for example we have two hidden layers, one with four neurons and one with three neurons. Notice that every neuron of a layer is connected to every neuron of the next layer.

#### STRUCTURE OF A NEURON

In order to understand how a neural network works in general, we need to understand how the individual neurons work.

As you can see, every neuron has a certain input, which is either the output of another neuron or the input of the first layer.

This number (which is the input) now gets multiplied by each of the weights (w1, w2, w3…) . After that, we subtract the bias b . The results of these calculations are the outputs of the neuron.
What I have just explained and what you can see on the picture is an outdated version of a neuron called a perceptron . Nowadays, we are using more complex neurons like the sigmoid neurons which use more sophisticated activation functions to calculate the outputs.

#### HOW NEURAL NETWORKS WORK

But what has all this to do with artificial intelligence or machine learning? Since neural networks are structures with a huge amount of parameters that can be changed, we can use certain algorithms so that the model can adjust itself. We input our data and the desired outcome. Then the model tries to adjust its weights and biases so that we can get from our inputs to the respective outputs.

Since we are dealing with multiple thousands of neurons, we can’t do all this manually.
We use different algorithms like backpropagation and gradient descent , to optimize and train our model. We are not going to deep into the mathematics here. Our focus will be on the coding and the implementation.
