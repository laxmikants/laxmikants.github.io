## React Native

React Native is framework to building mobile apps using JavaScript and React. 
React Native converts React code to Java for Android or Objective-C for iOS apps.
React Native uses most of the React concepts, like components, props, state and lifecycle methods.

- Advantages of React Native:

> You code one time, and you get two native apps (Android and iOS)

> You need not to have experience with Java, Objective-C, or Swift

> Faster development

> MIT license (open source)



- Requirements for Windows:

>  Android Studio

>  Android SDK (>= 7.0 Nougat)

>  Android AVD



#### Creating first React Native Application

In order to create our new React Native application, we need to install the react-native-cli package:

```{html, eval=FALSE}
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

Now, to create our first app:

1) Let's do it with this command:

```{html, eval=FALSE}
    react-native init MyFirstReactNativeApp
```

Once we built our React Native app, we need install Watchman, which is a file-watching service required by React Native. To install it, go to https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html and download the latest version for your OS (Windows, Mac, or Linux).

3) In this case, we are going to use Homebrew to install it for Mac. If you don't have Homebrew, you can install it with this command:

```{html, eval=FALSE}
    /usr/bin/ruby -e '$(curl -fsSL 
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)'
```

4) To install Watchman, you need to run:

```{html, eval=FALSE}
    brew update 
    brew install watchman
```

5) To start the React Native project, we need to use:

```{html, eval=FALSE}
    react-native start
```

If everything works fine, you should see this:

![](/img/main/reactnative.png)

7) Open a new terminal (Cmd + T) and run this command (depending on the device you want to use):

```{html, eval=FALSE}
    react-native run-ios 
    or
    react-native run-android
```

If there are no errors, you should see the simulator running the default application:

![](/img/main/reactnativeapp.png)


Now that we have our application running, let's open our code and modify it a bit:

a) Change the App.js file:

```{html, eval=FALSE}
  ...
  export default class App extends Component<Props> {
    render() {
      return (
        <View style={styles.container}>
          <Text style={styles.welcome}>
            This is my first React Native App!
          </Text>
          <Text style={styles.instructions}>
            To get started, edit App.js
          </Text>
          <Text style={styles.instructions}>{instructions}</Text>
        </View>
      );
    }
  }
  ...
File: App.js
```

b) If you go to the simulator again, you will need to press Cmd + R to reload the app to see the new changes reflected:

![](/img/main/reactnativeapp1.png)



#### Summary:

React Native is an framework which helps web developers in creating the robust
mobile applications using their existing JavaScript knowledge. It offers more faster mobile
development and more efficient code sharing between iOS, Android, and the web
without sacrificing the end userâ€™s experience or application quality.
